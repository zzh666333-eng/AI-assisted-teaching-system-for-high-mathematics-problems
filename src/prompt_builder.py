Prompt Builder - Core Anchor & Multi-Dimensional Fusion (V4.0)
Optimizations:
1. Deprecated Exam paper package mode, changed to generating "deep fusion comprehensive problems".
2. Introduced "core anchor + related knowledge points" prompt logic.
3. Strengthened robustness of LaTeX double escaping and JSON structure.
